## How to solve it

1. Understand that problem: what is the unknown? what are the data? what is the condition? is it possible to satisfy the condition? is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown? is it insufficient or rundant or contradictory?
2. What are the inputs?
3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution?
4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
5. how should I label the variables
