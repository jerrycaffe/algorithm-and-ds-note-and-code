1. Motivation for the need of big 0 notation  - when having multiple implementations of the same function, to know which is better is to calculate the big 0 notation to see the impact on the computer resource so as to decide which will stand the test of large inputs e.g check the file on reverse string using naive and optimized solution to solve the problem
2. Describe what big 0 natation is
3. simplify Big 0 expressions
4. time complexity and space complecity
5. evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithins using big o notation
6. describe what a lograrithm is
